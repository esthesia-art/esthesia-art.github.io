									<h1>The Art Connection</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Art is what makes our lives rich. We are surrounded by art all the time: whether it is a view of a serene lake or portrait of a folk dancer; in this ebb and flow of life, we rest our souls to take refuge in the world of arts. The diverse and vibrant culture of Gujarat spread across the state, from folk music to the delightful dance forms, from Rogan and Warli paintings to the glorious sculptures, the art in all its forms compliments our lives.</p>
								<h2>Art Exhibitions in our Gallery</h2>
								<p>With our first inaugural event from February 5th to the 15th, where we displayed our own paintings - it has been a great start. There were more than a 100 people visiting the gallery on a daily basis and most of the artwork that we had displayed was sold. We invite artists from around here to contact us for an exclusive or even an inclusive exhibition event where we can display their art and promote the event.</p>
